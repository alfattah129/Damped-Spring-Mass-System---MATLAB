# Damped-Spring-Mass-System---MATLAB
# Description & Key Contributions:

-- Developed a MATLAB-based graphical interface to simulate a damped spring–mass system numerically.

-- Implemented second-order differential equations to compute position and velocity over time.

-- Enabled user-defined inputs for system parameters — mass, damping constant, spring constant, and external force function 

-- Automated the classification of damping conditions (under-, over-, and critically damped) based on user input.

-- Visualized position–time and velocity–time responses dynamically within the GUI.

-- Verified system behavior through 10 different test cases to ensure numerical stability and accuracy.
